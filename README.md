## 📊 Dashboard Overview

![Dashboard Overview](present in the repository)

---

## 📁 Dataset Summary

- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Rows:** ~3,800 patients
- **Fields:** Age, Tumor Size, Estrogen Status, Race, Survival Months, Nodes Examined, etc.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Removed null and inconsistent entries
- Standardized categorical values (e.g., "Estrogen Status")
- Converted data types (age, tumor size, etc.)
- Calculated derived metrics (e.g., Average Survival, Percentage Alive)

---
### 📌 Count of Survival Months by Age

Distribution of survival months across different age ranges.

---
### 📌 Average Survival by Race

Pie chart comparing average survival months across racial groups.

---
### 📌 Tumor Size by Estrogen Status

Bar chart comparing average tumor size between Estrogen-positive and Estrogen-negative patients.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Younger patients** showed wider variation in tumor sizes.
- **White and Black populations** had lower average survival compared to other racial groups.
- Estrogen-negative patients tend to have **larger tumors**.
- Over **84%** of patients were still alive at the time of reporting.
- Highest number of **regional nodes examined** were in the 40–60 age range.
